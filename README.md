# Web Services

A simple service that is accessible in a variety of ways using different technologies. The application has the following features:

- Access the data using simple http web service calls

- Google App Engine or Microsoft Azure to implement the application on a remote cloud based server

- Options to return the data in text, JSON (the default) or XML

- A WSDL description of the interface to the web server

- Access to the data using RESTful type interaction

- An Ajax based front end to restrieve the data and display it in a suitable format using library based routines for an enhanced user interface

The Documents folder contains the basic sql scripts and assignment specification

For more information about how the above was implemented, please refer to the assignment report pdf
